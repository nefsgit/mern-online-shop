Online Shop project with React / Node / Express / MongoDB / Stripe

Basic responsive e-commerce website made on a MERN stack with Stripe, Redux, React-Query, Styled Components, Material UI and Cloudinary, and Jest for testing. This project is a learning experience in fullstack development for me as a beginner, so if you find inconsistencies in the way some things are done, it's because I was experimenting with several different tools and methods. Based on the e-commerce app by Chaoo Charles - https://www.youtube.com/c/ChaooCharles.

The .env file was kept to represent the variables used in the app - their values were replaced by placeholders with a brief description of what they are supposed to contain.
